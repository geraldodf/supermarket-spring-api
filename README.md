## Back-End Supermarket

Project which I make my portfolio, in order to show my experience. It was also completely created from absolute 0 by me. I also have it as an api consumed by my 2 front end projects.

Here I apply all new knowledge such as tests, design patterns, best practices, and even functional programming in Java.

### This project is not finished, I will be making changes frequently and refactoring when necessary.
